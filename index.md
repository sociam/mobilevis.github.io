**Supporting Algorithm Accountability using Provenance — Opportunities and Challenges** is a half-day satellite event that is to take place as part of [Provenance Week 2018](http://provenanceweek2018.org) at King’s College London, 12 July, 2018. The workshop aims to bring together researchers from different research areas, including law, machine learning, ethics as well as provenance, to explore challenges and opportunities for provenance-based algorithm accountability.

Concerns about the fairness of computational algorithms are increasingly growing. It is widely recognised that algorithms are playing an important role in our life. And more of us are demanding more transparency regarding how our personal data might be processed and used by algorithms. This demand for transparency and accountability in algorithms is not new. It has been an active research topic in areas like Artificial Intelligence, Human Computer Interactions and etc. 

Provenance information has a long standing history in supporting scientific research and enhancing its rigour. Validating and enabling reproducibility of research results are part of the core motivations for provenance research. However, the potential role of provenance information in facilitating algorithm transparency and accountability is less known or well understood. Therefore, this half-day workshop aims to bring together researchers from different research areas, including law, machine learning, ethics as well as provenance, to explore challenges and opportunities for provenance-based algorithm accountability.

## Aims

The workshop has three primary goals:
* To solicit and discuss case studies that will benefit from provenance research and technologies for supporting algorithm accountability
* To facilitate research collaborations and initiatives between provenance researchers and researchers from other areas working on algorithm accountability
* To identify gaps and open challenges in provenance research to support algorithm accountability

### Invited speakers
* [Jat Singh](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~js573/) is an EPSRC Research Fellow at the Department of Computer Science & Technology (Computer Laboratory), University of Cambridge. His research concerns the technical and legal aspects of systems. His core interests span areas including security, privacy, management and audit, typically in the context of cloud and distributed environments (Internet of Things). His is currently leading two EPRSC research/fellowship projects: Realising Accountable Intelligent Systems (RAInS) and Towards a legally-compliant Internet of Things. 

* [Michael Veale](http://michae.lv) is a technology policy researcher sitting between the Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy (STEaPP) and the Department of Computer Science at University College London. His research focuses on building new sociotechnical tools (such as methods, software and guidelines) to assess the impact of machine-learning algorithms that make societal decisions, particularly in the public sector. He has a BSc from LSE and an MSc from Maastricht University, tweets at @mikarv and can also be found at http://michae.lv . 

  * **Talk Abstract** Much has been said about how machine learning systems may create policy problems concerning fairness, accountability, privacy and power asymmetries. This talk argues that a significant omission from ethical frameworks discussed to date surrounds the provenance of these models. Given the rise in the trading or provision of trained models rather than the direct sharing of data, and the enormous disparities in privacy law around the world, this talk anticipates and analyses an emerging governance gap surrounding the social acceptability of the conditions under which the data used to train machine learning systems were obtained. This talk first asks whether European data protection law contemplates such a challenge, concluding it has few tools applicable in this context. Looking across sectors, however, this situation has surprising mirrors in sustainability standards, such as Fairtrade and Rainforest Alliance, applied to global product and commodity supply chains. Lastly, it considers the extent to which, given recent computer science research, the underlying technologies might be amenable to such governance, and if not, what might lead them to slip up.
