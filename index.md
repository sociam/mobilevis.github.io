**Supporting Algorithm Accountability using Provenance — Opportunities and Challenges** is a half-day satellite event that is to take place as part of [Provenance Week 2018](http://provenanceweek2018.org) at King’s College London, 12 July, 2018. The workshop aims to bring together researchers from different research areas, including law, machine learning, ethics as well as provenance, to explore challenges and opportunities for provenance-based algorithm accountability.

Concerns about the fairness of computational algorithms are increasingly growing. It is widely recognised that algorithms are playing an important role in our life. And more of us are demanding more transparency regarding how our personal data might be processed and used by algorithms. This demand for transparency and accountability in algorithms is not new. It has been an active research topic in areas like Artificial Intelligence, Human Computer Interactions and etc. 

Provenance information has a long standing history in supporting scientific research and enhancing its rigour. Validating and enabling reproducibility of research results are part of the core motivations for provenance research. However, the potential role of provenance information in facilitating algorithm transparency and accountability is less known or well understood. Therefore, this half-day workshop aims to bring together researchers from different research areas, including law, machine learning, ethics as well as provenance, to explore challenges and opportunities for provenance-based algorithm accountability.

## Aims

The workshop has three primary goals:
* To solicit and discuss case studies that will benefit from provenance research and technologies for supporting algorithm accountability
* To facilitate research collaborations and initiatives between provenance researchers and researchers from other areas working on algorithm accountability
* To identify gaps and open challenges in provenance research to support algorithm accountability
